# uh-its-wp-manoa-dept-theme
Theme for University of Hawai‘i Mānoa college, schools, departments and groups.

This theme was developed by Information Technology Services (ITS https://hawaii.edu/its) for use in their multi-site Wordpress web-hosting to be accessible, mobile-friendly, and easy to edit. As this is a vanilla theme to be used across many departments, change requests will be assessed based on the broad benefit to all users.

WP training documentation is accessible to anyone with a University of Hawai‘i login:
* [Getting Started](go.hawaii.edu/1aG)
* [Editing Posts & Pages](go.hawaii.edu/Gae)

Download [Docker](https://github.com/UniversityOfHawaii/gulp-docker-example) and follow the directions in the repository README to compile SCSS. Make sure to add to .gitignore:
* node_modules
* css
* .npm-cache

__ITS Specific Notes__
The css will be compiled on the server.

All changes to the site theme should be made via the Jenkins server, NOT directly in the FTP.
